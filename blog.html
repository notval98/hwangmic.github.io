		<h2>First Web Development Assignment, 12 April 2021</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>One of the challenges that I faced when working on this assignment waas getting used to working with <br>
				git. I spent a short amount of time learning git previously, but I have since forgotten it all. It was <br>
				challenging relearning how set things up and then stage the files to commit. </li>
			<li>After having completed this assignment, I feel a little more confident when it comes to working with <br>
				git and then staging files to be committed. I have previously worked with html before so working with <br>
				it feels familiar. </li>
			<li>The recorded video lectures were the most useful to me in this assignment. It was useful having a video <br> 
				walk me through how to use git and show how to write in html. </li>
		</ul>

		
		<h2>Assignment 2, 26 April 2021</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>The most challenging thing for me this assignment was working on the flexboxes and styling the things <br>
				inside of them. I was not able to solve many of the problems that I had with the flexboxes unfortunately.<br>
				I was also having some trouble with getting the navbar search input and button to be on the right side <br>
				of the viewport, but I was able to solve it by making their postions fixed to the right of the browser. <br>
				I also had a little bit of trouble making the twit author links styled as well, but I was able to resolve <br>
				it when I noticed that the author links were styled similarly to the navbar links. They difference was <br>
				that I did not make the author links have the easing in underline when hovered over by the cursor. I was <br>
				also having trouble with keeping the twit content inside of their respective boxes when resizing the <br>
				browser window.</li>
			<li>I spent a lot of time relearning some basic css styling from this assignment at first. I vaguely remembered <br>
				how to do some styling like changing colors, fonts, styling links, cursor hover reaction, and backgrounds. <br>
				But I spent most of my time trying to learn how to style flexboxes and their contents. </li>
			<li>I heavily leaned on w3schools and their css tutorials for this asssignment. I also used the recored lectures <br>
				a lot for getting some instruction when it came to selectors and gaining a better understanding of what I was <br>
				reading in the website tutorials. I also used a couple youtube tutorials for flexboxes and getting started <br>
				on the navbar.</li>
			<li>I specifically had to search for flexbox tutorials and link styling on Google. Flexboxes because this is <br>
				the first time that I have worked with them. And styling link and buttons because I was having trouble <br>
				with styling the twit author name links inside of the flexboxes.</li>
