		<h2>First Web Development Assignment, 12 April 2021</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>One of the challenges that I faced when working on this assignment waas getting used to working with <br>
				git. I spent a short amount of time learning git previously, but I have since forgotten it all. It was <br>
				challenging relearning how set things up and then stage the files to commit. </li>
			<li>After having completed this assignment, I feel a little more confident when it comes to working with <br>
				git and then staging files to be committed. I have previously worked with html before so working with <br>
				it feels familiar. </li>
			<li>The recorded video lectures were the most useful to me in this assignment. It was useful having a video <br> 
				walk me through how to use git and show how to write in html. </li>
