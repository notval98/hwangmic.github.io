		<h2>First Web Development Assignment, 12 April 2021</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>What challenges or troubles did you have compelting this assignment?<br>
				One of the challenges that I faced when working on this assignment waas getting used to working with <br>
				git. I spent a short amount of time learning git previously, but I have since forgotten it all. It was <br>
				challenging relearning how set things up and then stage the files to commit. </li>

			<li>What did you learn from this assignment? <br>
				After having completed this assignment, I feel a little more confident when it comes to working with <br>
				git and then staging files to be committed. I have previously worked with html before so working with <br>
				it feels familiar. </li>

			<li>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? <br>
				The recorded video lectures were the most useful to me in this assignment. It was useful having a video <br> 
				walk me through how to use git and show how to write in html. </li>
		</ul>

		
		<h2>Assignment 2, 26 April 2021</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>What was challenging about the assignment? <br>
				The most challenging thing for me this assignment was working on the flexboxes and styling the things <br>
				inside of them. I was not able to solve many of the problems that I had with the flexboxes unfortunately.<br>
				I was also having some trouble with getting the navbar search input and button to be on the right side <br>
				of the viewport, but I was able to solve it by making their postions fixed to the right of the browser. <br>
				I also had a little bit of trouble making the twit author links styled as well, but I was able to resolve <br>
				it when I noticed that the author links were styled similarly to the navbar links. They difference was <br>
				that I did not make the author links have the easing in underline when hovered over by the cursor. I was <br>
				also having trouble with keeping the twit content inside of their respective boxes when resizing the <br>
				browser window. I was also having some trouble publishing the assignment to the engineering server. </li>

			<li>What did you learn from the assignemtn? <br>
				I spent a lot of time relearning some basic css styling from this assignment at first. I vaguely remembered <br>
				how to do some styling like changing colors, fonts, styling links, cursor hover reaction, and backgrounds. <br>
				But I spent most of my time trying to learn how to style flexboxes and their contents. </li>

			<li>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? <br>
				I heavily leaned on w3schools and their css tutorials for this asssignment. I also used the recored lectures <br>
				a lot for getting some instruction when it came to selectors and gaining a better understanding of what I was <br>
				reading in the website tutorials. I also used a couple youtube tutorials for flexboxes and getting started <br>
				on the navbar. I used campuswire to publish the assignment to the engineering servers. </li>

			<li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment? <br>
				I specifically had to search for flexbox tutorials and link styling on Google. Flexboxes because this is <br>
				the first time that I have worked with them. And styling link and buttons because I was having trouble <br>
				with styling the twit author name links inside of the flexboxes. I also used campuswire to make a post <br>
				about how to publish this assignment to the public engineering website because I forgot how to do it. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Assignment 3, 10 May 2021</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>What was challenging about the assignment? <br>
				This was my first time writing in javascript so there was a lot of learning that had to be done. I had a lot <br>
				trouble getting the search bar function to work properly as well as figuring out how to open the modal for <br>
				adding new twits. I mostly struggled with the search function to work correctly and having it be an elegant <br>
				solution. I had a lot of issues when creating functions and having the corret naming conventions and arguments <br>
				which led to a lot of trial and error. I had some issues where the search function would be looking at the wrong <br>
				index or it would not make the user input and the twit content lower case. </li>

			<li>What did you learn from the assignment? <br>
				Since this was my first time working with javascript, everything was new and had to be learned. I found <br>
				that there were somethings like passing arguments between functions that were similar to things I've done <br>
				in C++ but the majority of the things that were done specifically with javascript was new. I found that <br>
				adding in content using "document.createElement" was the easiest part of the assignment because that <br>
				was shown explicitly in the video lectures. Coding the search bar was almost familiar because I have done <br>
				similar tasks in  C++ where you go through an array and compared its contents. But the modal was definitely <br>
				all new to me.</li>

			<li>What are one or two things that you had to Goggle to complete the assignment? <br>
				I had to Google how to unhide the modal when the create new twit button was pressed. And I had to search <br>
				for how a search function was implemented in javascript. I knew how to do this in theory but I did not <br>
				know some of the javascript syntax for this task. The last thing that I had to search for was the alert <br>
				if the new twit inputs were empty. I think that it was in the video lecture but I searched for it on <br>
				Google to be sure. </li>
