	<p>I have no experience in web development. I have tried learning git in the past but I don't have a lot <br>
	    of experience.</p>
	<p>I hope to improve my skills in using git and understanding the workflow when developing code using of<br>
	    web development and furthering my understanding of web development.</p>
	<p>I have not signed up for the Piazza forum for this class but I have signed up for campuswire.</p>
	<p>The most unique experience I have had so far is climbing up the Chief with my dad in Squamish, Canada.<br>
 	    It is a roughly 2,000 foot tall granite monolith in the middle of Brithish Columbia. It was <br>
	    incredible being so high off the ground and you could really tell because there was only a bit of <br>
	    rope that was keeping you safe and tied to the near vertical walls.</p>
