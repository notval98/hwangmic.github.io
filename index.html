			<li>The most complex thing that I have done with web development is making a webpage for a claass in high <br>
			    school. I have no other experience in web development. I have tried learning git in the past but I <br> 
			  	don't have a lot of experience in using git.</li>

			<li>I hope to improve my skills in using git and understanding the workflow when developing code using of<br>
			    web development and furthering my understanding of web development.</li>

			<li>I have not signed up for the Piazza forum for this class but I have signed up for campuswire.</li>

			<li>The most unique experience I have had so far is climbing up the Chief with my dad in Squamish, Canada.<br>
		 	    It is a roughly 2,000 foot tall granite monolith in the middle of Brithish Columbia. It was <br>
			    incredible being so high off the ground and you could really tell because there was only a bit of <br>
			    rope that was keeping you safe and tied to the near vertical walls.</li>
